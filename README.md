## ☕ Buy me a coffee

Block is my second *real world* project (after [mon.icu frontend](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/monicu-frontend),
which you could also check out), and it brings me a lot of joy to develop and maintain it! But if you also had fun using
it and it really came in handy, you could give me even more joy by supporting me with a spare change 💚
